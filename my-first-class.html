      <h3>Variables in cpp</h3>
      <p>
        First topic is variables in C++, now you
        may be wondering what are variables, well
        I am here to answer that question. Variables
        are the like a container. It stores/contains 
        a value, which can be changed later. 
      </p>
      <p>
        for example:
        <div id="example">
          <h5>int x = 4;</h5>
          <p>
             Here the int is a data-type whereas x
            is a variable name. here the variable x
            is assigned the integer value 4.

      <h3>Operators in C++</h3>
      <p>
        Moving on to operators, there are dfferent 
        types of operators in C++. Including arithmetic
        operators, relational operators, logical operators and 
        bitwise operators. Now, on to the explaination
      </p>
      <h2> 1. Arithmetic Operators</h2>
      <p>
        Arithmetic operators are used to perform
        mathematical operations. for example:
        <div id="example">
          <h5>int x = 4;</h5>
          <h5>int y = 2;</h5>
          <h5>int z = x + y;</h5>
          <h5>int a = x - y;</h5>
          <h5>int b = x * y;</h5>
          <h5>int c = x / y;</h5>
        </div>
        Here, we can see that the arithmetic operators
        are used to perform mathematical operations such
        as + , - , * , / which refers to plus, minus
        multiplication and division respectively.
        <h2> 2. Relational Operators</h2>
        They are used to compare two values. for example:
        <h2></h2>
        <div id="example">
          <h5>int x = 4;</h5>
          <h5>int y = 2;</h5>
          <h5>we will be using std::cout which is just
            used to print something on the terminal/screen.
          </h5>
          <h5>std::cout << (x == y); //Prints false</h5>
          <h5>std::cout << (x != y); //Prints true</h5>
          <h5>std::cout << (x > y); //Prints true</h5>
          <h5>std::cout << (x < y); //Prints false</h5>
        </div>
        from this we can learn about the different types of
        relational operators including == (equal to), != (not equal to),
        (>) greater than, (<) less than. the values will be outputted
        in boolean , i.e. , true or false.
