        <h3>Our first C++ program</h3>
          C++ is an object-oriented programming language. 
          It is used to develop applications, games and websites.
          Today we are going to write our first c++ code.
          <div id="example">
            <h5>int main(){</h5>
            <h5>std::cout << "Hello World";</h5>
            <h5>return 0;</h5>
            <h5>}</h5>
          </div>
          the output on terminal will be:
          <div id="output">
            Hello World
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
          <h3>if-else in C++</h3>
          now we are at one of the first function at coding,
          the if-else statement. As the name states, there is a
          condition given, which could either be true or false.
          If the said condition is true the given block of code will
          run.
          <div id="example">
            <h5>int main(){</h5>
            <h5>int age = 18;</h5>
            <h5>if(age > 18){</h5>
            <h5>std::cout << "You are an adult";</h5>
            <h5>}else{</h5>
            <h5>std::cout << "You are not an adult";</h5>
            <h5>}</h5>
            <h5>return 0;</h5>
            <h5>}</h5>
          </div>
          the output on terminal will be:
          <div id="output">
            You are an adult
          </div>
          as the age was 18 the condition was true so the block
          of code inside if statement was executed. But if the other one was true, the 
          else part would have been used.
        </div>
        </p>
